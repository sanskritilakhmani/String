 **String**
 
 
 _In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

 _Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks._

_'hello' is the same as "hello"._
